As long as you're saying anything legal and obviously technology related,
you're fine. Be yourself. Even if you're a jerk.

Feel free to educate people (myself included). Feel free to remind anyone
(myself included) that life if tough, people are mean, and life is sometimes a
bitch, and it is up to everyone of us to learn to deal with all that.
